# 2018 School Report Card
The Houston Chronicle's School Report Card single-page application built using AngularJS.

This app is part of our larger annual School Report Card project. Users can search individual campuses or districts to see how they have fared over the years. This is an iterative project and will be continually updated as we get new data and add new features.
